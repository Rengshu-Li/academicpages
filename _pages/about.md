Hi, I’m Rengshu Li, born in Hunan and raised in Beijing, China. As a first-generation college student, I’m grateful to my parents for giving me the chance to freely explore my own path. I’ve stumbled here and there, taken what some might call “detours,” but I believe no step is ever wasted — every choice has shaped who I am today.  

In my name, “Shu” (树) means “tree.” I see myself as a tree too — always observing, always growing, sometimes weathering storms but still reaching for the light. Every new experience adds another ring to my story. For me, life is a tree full of possibilities, and I’m still growing mine.
