The spontaneous Baijiu fermentation system harbors a complex microbiome that is highly dynamic in time and space and varies depending on the Jiuqu starters and environmental factors. The intricate microbiota presents in the fermentation environment is responsible for carrying out various reactions. These reactions necessitate the interaction among the core microbes to influence the community function, ultimately shaping the distinct Baijiu styles through the process of spontaneous fermentation. Numerous studies have been conducted to enhance our understanding of the diversity, succession, and function of microbial communities with the aim of improving fermentation manipulation. However, a comprehensive and critical assessment of the core microbes and their interaction remains one of the significant challenges in the Baijiu fermentation industry. This paper focuses on the fermentation properties of core microbes. We discuss the state of the art of microbial traceability, highlighting the crucial role of environmental and starter microbiota in the Baijiu brewing microbiome. Also, we discuss the various interactions between microbes in the Baijiu production system and propose a potential conceptual framework that involves constructing predictive network models to simplify and quantify microbial interactions using co-culture models. This approach offers effective strategies for understanding the core microbes and their interactions, thus beneficial for the management of microbiota and the regulation of interactions in Baijiu fermentation processes.
